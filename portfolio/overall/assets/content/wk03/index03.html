        <!-- <h1> tag: this is the largest of the 'heading' tags, which are different from the 'head' metadata tag. -->

        <h1>Jeff Walley's Week 03  & Week 04 Webpage with External CSS Stylesheet</h1>

        <!-- <p> tag: the <p> tag denotes a new paragraph of text in the webpage. -->
        <p>This week we link an external CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) =>

            <!-- <br> tag: line break tag, used to create a single line break. The <br> tag is an 'empty tag' meaning that it DOES NOT need an end tag. -->
            <br><br>
            <!-- <i> tag: make text between <i> tag italic. -->
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"/&gt;

            <br>
            <br>
            The 'link' tag allows us to specify an external path that holds the webpage's CSS style file.
            <br>
            By keeping the CSS file in an external location we can have a cleaner HTML structure. Having an external
            file also helps with templating and reusability of our webcode.
            <br>
            <br>
            The 'rel', or relation/ship, attribute is equal to "stylesheet". This tells the browser that we are using a
            stylesheet in the link.
            <br>
            <br>
            Next we have the 'type' attribute, which tells the browser that the stylesheet is in "text/css" format.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally we have the 'href' attribute. The href is where you enter the URL of a page you want to use as
            link.

            <!-- </p> end tag: close a <p> paragraph section of the HTML file. -->

            <p>This is a sign that tells drivers to keep left. I do use AI in webdesign. I get AI to generate text that is more relevant than 'lorem ipsum' with only slightly more effort. The following text is AI generated: <em>A “keep left” sign in traffic indicates that drivers must stay to the left side of the road or lane. This sign is typically used in countries where vehicles drive on the left side of the road, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and India. It helps to ensure smooth traffic flow and prevent accidents by guiding drivers to follow the correct path, especially in areas with divided highways, roundabouts, or construction zones. Ignoring this sign can lead to traffic violations and potential hazards on the road.</em>

            <p>This sign tells drivers to stay right. The following interesting about 'Stay Right' signs is brought to you by AI: <em>A “stay right” sign in traffic directs drivers to keep to the right side of the road or lane. This sign is commonly used in countries where vehicles drive on the right side of the road, such as the United States, Canada, and most European countries. It helps maintain orderly traffic flow and enhances safety by ensuring that drivers follow the correct path, particularly in areas with divided highways, construction zones, or when approaching obstacles. Disregarding this sign can result in traffic violations and increase the risk of accidents.</em>
