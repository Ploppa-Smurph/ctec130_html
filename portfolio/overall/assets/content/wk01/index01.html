                <p>My name is Jeff and I love to play with computers. I grew up in the early 80's and have been toying
                    with computers for years.

                    <!-- <br> tag: line break tag, used to create a single line break. The <br> tag is an 'empty tag' meaning that it DOES NOT need an end tag. -->
                    <br><br>
                    I recently became more serious about learning computer networking and security and obtained an
                    Associates in Cybersecurity from Bossier Parish Community College over the summer.

                    I keep my class notes on a github repository. Here is the URL, but not the link. I'll wait for a
                    different exercise to make it a link.

                    Over the course of the semester I will cement my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will also
                    supplement my time learning HTMX, which is responsive web design that does not rely on JavaScript as
                    heavily.
