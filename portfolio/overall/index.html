            <h1>Jeff Walley's Week 03 Webpage with External CSS Stylesheet</h1>

            <!-- <p> tag: the <p> tag denotes a new paragraph of text in the webpage. -->
            <p>This week we link an external CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) =>

                <!-- <i> tag: make text between <i> tag italic. -->
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"/&gt;

                <!-- <br> tag: line break tag, used to create a single line break. The <br> tag is an 'empty tag' meaning that it DOES NOT need an end tag. -->
                <br>
                <br>
                The 'link' tag allows us to specify an external path that hold our CSS file.
                <br>
                By keeping the CSS file in an external location we can have a cleaner HTML structure. Having an external
                file also helps with templating and reusability of our webcode.
                <br>
                <br>
                The 'rel', or relation, attribute is equal to "stylesheet". This tells the browser that we are using a
                stylesheet in the link.
                <br>
                <br>
                Next we have the 'type' attribute, which tells the browser that the stylesheet is in "text/css" format.
                <br>
                <br>
                Finally we have the 'href' attribute. The href is where you enter the URL of a page you want to use as
                link. In the case of a stylesheet it is often a local path to the CSS file.
