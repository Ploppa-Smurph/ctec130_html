    <!-- <p> tag: the <p> tag denotes a new paragraph of text in the webpage. -->
              <p>This week we link an external CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) =>
        
    <!-- <i> tag: make text between <i> tag italic. -->
              &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"/&gt;
        
    <!-- <br> tag: line break tag, used to create a single line break. The <br> tag is an 'empty tag' meaning that it DOES NOT need an end tag. -->
              <br>
              <br>
              The 'link' tag allows us to specify an external path that hold our CSS file. 
              <br>
              By keeping the CSS file in an external location we can have a cleaner HTML structure. Having an external file also helps with templating and reusability of our webcode.
              <br>
              <br>
              The 'rel', or relation, attribute is equal to "stylesheet". This tells the browser that we are using a stylesheet in the link. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Next we have the 'type' attribute, which tells the browser that the stylesheet is in "text/css" format.
              <br>
              <br>
              Finally we have the 'href' attribute. The href is where you enter the URL of a page you want to use as link. In the case of a styleshee it is often a local path to the CSS file.
    
    <!-- </p> end tag: close a <p> paragraph section of the HTML file. -->

    <!-- An 'h2 tag' is considered a sub-heading of 'h1' and each smaller size is a further subheading. -->
              <h2>This is a 'h2 tag'</h2>
              <p>'h2 tags are used as a subheading under the main title.
