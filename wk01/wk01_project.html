        <h1>Jeffrey S. Walley</h1>
        <p>My name is Jeff and I love to play with computers. I grew up in the early 80's and have been toying with computers for years.
        <br><br>
        I recently became more serious about learnining computer networking and security and obtained an Associates in Cybersecurity from Bossier Parish Community College over the summer.

        I keep my class notes on a github repository. Here is the URL, but not the link. I'll wait for a different exercise to make it a link.

        <br><br>
        Over the course of the semester I will cement my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will also supplement my time learning HTMX, which is responsive web design that does not rely on JavaScript as heavily.
